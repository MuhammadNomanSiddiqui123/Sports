                                        Football is governed by a set of rules that ensure fair play and structure, such as the
                                        offside rule
                                        and the prohibition of fouls. Players aim to score by placing the ball in the opponentâ€™s
                                        goal while
                                        adhering to these rules.

                                          Throw-ins: When the ball goes out of bounds over the sideline, the opposing team is
                                          awarded a
                                          throw-in, where the player must throw the ball back into play using both hands while

Over time, racquets were introduced in the 16th century, and the game became more structured. By the late 19th century, tennis evolved into the modern version we know today, with the establishment of formal rules and the formation of the All England Club, which hosted the first Wimbledon tournament in 1877. Lawn tennis, as it was called, quickly spread worldwide, becoming an immensely popular sport. </p>

                                    <p class="card-text" style="text-transform: unset;">Billiards originated in Europe during the 15th century as an outdoor game resembling croquet, where players used mallets to hit balls on grass. By the late 1600s, the game transitioned indoors, with players using cue sticks to strike balls on a wooden table, leading to the creation of modern billiards. Over time, various formats evolved, including pool, snooker, and carom, each with distinct rules and play styles, solidifying billiards as a popular indoor sport worldwide. </p>
